Food ordering System
Alik project is a project that I created with the deaf and the dumb in mind. On noticing how they struggle to order a simple meal, often having to point at pictures, I decided 
to develop a system that would not only make it easy for them to order whatever they want, but also pay in real time. This is a restaurant oriented system and therefore not
your typical food ordering system used to order food from the comfort of your home.
